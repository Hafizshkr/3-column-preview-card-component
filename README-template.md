- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

What I've learned from this project is how to handle CSS, including how to organize boxes using flex-direction and how to center content. This project has been really helpful for me in improving areas where I lacked skills.



### Continued development

I need to focus on how CSS works, especially when working on responsive design. It's like my weakness, but I need to improve in that area.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-direction.php) - This helped me for to understand how the flex direction works.

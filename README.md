### What I learned

What I've learned from this project is how to handle CSS, including how to organize boxes using flex-direction and how to center content. This project has been really helpful for me in improving areas where I lacked skills.



### Continued development

I need to focus on how CSS works, especially when working on responsive design. It's like my weakness, but I need to improve in that area.
